# Google Homepage

This site is a project for the HTML/CSS portion of **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com "The Odin Project")**.

## Purpose
Building this Google search site demonstrates a working knowledge of HTML and CSS and helps to get more familiar with the Git process. 
### HTML/CSS Shown
  * Basic Navigation bar on top and bottom of the page.
  * Basic Text, Link, Image, Table, and Form creation and use.
  * Background, Color and Shadow effects.
  * Highlight effects on hover, active use, and focus.
  * Creating custom buttons.
  * Overriding inherited styles from parent elements.
  * Custom placement of elements on a page ( both px and % based ).  


## Custom Sections
  While the project is meant to be an example of basic HTML/CSS usage and mentions not to worry about making the forms work or adding other features, I wanted to see if I could add a bit to make it more like the real site.
### Extra Items
  * "I'm Feeling Lucky" lottery Javascript with working submission.
  * Google Tools table dropdownwith Javascript  near top right.
  * Search and "I'm feeling lucky" both work.
